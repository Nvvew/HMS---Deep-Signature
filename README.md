# HMS with Signature Methods
This notebook provides a deep signature model in the Kaggle HMS - Harmful Brain Activity Classification Competition.  

This project is based on the excellent version of [HMS Submission - 1D EEGNet Pipeline Lightning](https://www.kaggle.com/code/nvveew/hms-submission-1d-eegnet-pipeline-lightning) and [HMS Resnet1d GRU Inference - 1 / 5 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/konstantinboyko/hms-resnet1d-gru-inference-1-5-dataset)
